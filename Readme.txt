The libraries are from Princeton University official website <http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/>
The libraries that are used from this Standard Library are:-
    In.java (read numbers and text from files and URLs)
    StdIn.java (read numbers and text from standard input)
    StdOut.java (write numbers and text to standard output)
    StdDraw.java (draw geometric shapes in a window)

We got this library from studying the algorithm online course from Coursera.
It simplifies the Input and Output method as well as GUI display
so we can focus more on coding the algorithm.
